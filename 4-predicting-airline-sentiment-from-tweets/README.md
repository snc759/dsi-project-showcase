# Hackathon Project ðŸš€

Pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model with it. 

## Timeline

- By 10:30am ET, Slack the instructional team your 1-line problem statement and the name of your dataset. We will give you a thumbs up or ask questions/make suggestions.
- Commit regularly.
- By 4:15pm ET, make your final push to your GitHub submission repo. 
- At 4:20pm ET, we'll do 5-minute lightning talks where you'll tell the class what you found. No slides necessary - you can walk us through your Jupyter notebook. 

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. But you will be amazed what you can accomplish in a day! 

We're not expecting anything as polished as project three, for example. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

Make a null model. Then start with a super simple model for your first real model. Don't be afraid to use a subset of the data for faster iteration when you are working out your modeling process.

If you have a big data file, keep it out of GitHub by using your _.gitignore_ file.

## Datasets

You can pick any dataset you're interested in. We suggest not picking a dataset that will take several hours to clean. Do not use your capstone dataset.

Your dataset and problem do not need to be novel, but please do not pick a dataset that you have used before or that is extremely common in data science examples (such as Titanic, Iris, MNIST, etc.). 

There are many curated collections of interesting datasets online. Here are a few links to get you started:

Reminder: do not duplicate someone else's work and give credit where credit is due.

## Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
