### Problem Statement

New prospective homeowners or those looking to buy a house, often want to know understand and evaluate the value of a house, based on its features and characteristics.  In order to value a house and to see how each of its features affects its value and therefore, its Sale Price, developing a predictive model that could predict the Sale Price of a house, as well as show the importance of certain house features to that Sale Price, would be beneficial for prospective homeowners.  

This project aims to give prospective homeowners an accurate valuation of a house based on its characteristics.  The goal will be accurately predict the Sale Price of a house, while still maintaining interpretability among the features to show the audience which features have a strong impace on the target variable (Sale Price).

The audience of my project will be prospective homeowners that have hired me as a data scientist to help them evaluate the sale price of a house, and what characteristics really drive up that price. I will be a Data Scientist consultant out for hire, analyzing the Ames Housing Data between the years 2006 and 2010.

### Conclusions 

To the prospective homeowner there are a few conclusions about what drives up the price of a house: 
- A house in College Creek neighborhood, then holding everything else constant, on average the sale price of the house will be \$20,080 less than a house bought in Bloomington Heights neighborhood
- A house bought in Meadow Village neighborhood, on average, has a sale price that is \$19,030 more than a house bought in the Bloomington Heights neighborhood
- An increase in a houseâ€™s exterior material quality from, ex: good, to excellent, on average will lead to an increase in the Sale Price by \$17,250. 
- An increase in the Heating Quality and Condition, ex: Fair to average, will lead to an increase in the sale price by \$2,012 dollars. 
- An increase in the ordinal category of the Kitchen Quality ex: Typical to good, will lead to an average increase in the sale price by \$11,330.
- An increase in the ordinal category of the Fireplace Quality ex: Good to excellent, will lead to an average increase in the sale price by \$1,961. 


### Areas for Further Study/Research 
- Would want to collect more data such as how much sq ft per bed
- Would want to collect more current data 
- Would want to take the top-down approach for a model and put all features into a model right away
